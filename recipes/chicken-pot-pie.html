        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas and celery in a saucepan; add water 
                to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 mins, then remove from the
                heat and drain.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over 
                medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 
                minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.</li>
            <li>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. 
                Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid 
                mixture over top.</li>
            <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. 
                Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is 
                bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
